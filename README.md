# Simple-Unity-Sprite-Sheet-Generator

A simple and open-source and light weight unity-made sprite sheet generator, it uses drag and drops to allow for sprite sheet generation.

It can export to .png and .jpg but more formats will be available soon.

 - Current Features:
 
 1. Easily create sprite sheets using DnD.
 1. Simple (ugly) UI with a simple design window.
 1. Lightweight because it only relies on only 2 unity modules the IMGUI and Image Conversion modules.

- Planned Features:

1. Add more export options.
1. Improve the look of the UI.
1. Saving and loading of sprite sheets without exporting them. (using Json.NET)
1. Grids and ability to rotate sprites in side the sheet before exporting.

##### Please, keep in mind that I have created this project for my own use and to help test my skills out.
