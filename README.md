# Simple-Unity-Sprite-Sheet-Generator

A simple and open-source and light weight unity-made sprite sheet generator, it uses drag and drops to allow for sprite sheet generation.

It can export to .png and .jpg but more formats will be available soon.

 - Current Features:
 
 1. Easily create sprite sheets using DnD.
 1. Simple (ugly) UI with a simple design window.
 1. Lightweight because it only relies on only 2 unity modules the IMGUI and Image Conversion modules.
 1. Saving and loading of sprite sheets without exporting them. (using Json & Binary)

- Planned Features:

1. Add more export options.
1. Improve the look of the UI.
1. Grids and ability to rotate sprites in side the sheet before exporting.

###### Please, keep in mind that I have created this project for my own use and to help test my skills out and you are free to go ahead and grab the source code and use/modify/redistribute it anywhere without resirections.
